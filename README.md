<img align="left" alt="Python" width="30px" style="padding-right:30px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg"/>
A python based password manager that allows you to generate, change, find, delete and sort your passwords. Passwords are randomly generated and hard to crack.

## Usage
No Installs Required. Just run the following command and follow the prompts:
```sh
python manager.py
```

### CAUTION: If you are to use this, it is not secure! If someone got a hold of ```passwords.csv``` they would have all your passwords. Securing your files is your own responsibility... in this case at least.
